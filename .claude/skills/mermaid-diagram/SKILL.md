# Mermaid Diagram Skill

Create diagrams for blog posts: understand the content, pick the right diagram type, iterate with `mermaid-ascii` for terminal preview, then render SVG with `mmdc`. Optionally polish with Gemini image generation — either as a fallback when Mermaid can't produce a good layout, or as an enhancement step after Mermaid output to get a more polished look.

## Invocation

```
/mermaid-diagram [description, sketch, or reference image]
```

## Expected Input

The user will typically provide one or more of:

- **A blog post path** — read it to understand the concepts that need diagramming
- **A description** — what the diagram should convey
- **A reference image** — an existing diagram to recreate or adapt (the user places it in `drafts/img/`)
- **An ASCII sketch** — a rough layout to formalize

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Content

If working in the context of a blog post, **read the post first**. Understand:

- What concept or process needs a visual explanation
- What entities/steps/relationships are involved
- What level of detail serves the reader (not everything needs to be in the diagram)

### 2. Choose Diagram Type

Pick the type that best fits the content:

| Type | Keyword | Best for |
|------|---------|----------|
| Flowchart | `flowchart TD` / `flowchart LR` | Processes, trees, data flow |
| Sequence | `sequenceDiagram` | Interactions between actors over time |
| Class | `classDiagram` | Object relationships, system structure |
| State | `stateDiagram-v2` | State machines, lifecycles |
| ER | `erDiagram` | Database schemas, entity relationships |
| Mindmap | `mindmap` | Hierarchical brainstorming |

Flowchart directions: `TD` (top-down), `LR` (left-right), `RL`, `BT`.

Present the choice to the user before proceeding.

### 3. Look Up Syntax (if needed)

For flowcharts and sequence diagrams, the Quick Syntax Reference below is sufficient. For less common diagram types, fetch the docs:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/develop/packages/mermaid/src/docs/syntax/<type>.md
```

Where `<type>` is one of: `flowchart`, `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `stateDiagram`, `entityRelationshipDiagram`, `mindmap`, `timeline`, `gantt`, `pie`, `quadrantChart`, `block`, `architecture`, `sankey`, `xyChart`.

### 4. Draft the `.mmd` File

Write the full source file (with labels, styling, `classDef`) to `static/mmdc/<diagram-name>.mmd`. This is the file `mmdc` will render.

### 5. Preview with mermaid-ascii

`mermaid-ascii` is for quick structural verification in the terminal. It **cannot** parse the full Mermaid syntax, so you need to feed it a simplified version of the diagram.

**Critical: use bare node IDs only.** The `[label]` bracket syntax, `classDef`, `:::class` references, `<br/>`, and subgraphs all break `mermaid-ascii` or produce garbage output. Strip all of these for the preview.

Write a simplified preview file or pipe a stripped version:

```bash
# Option 1: separate preview file
mermaid-ascii -f static/mmdc/<diagram-name>-preview.mmd

# Option 2: inline via stdin
echo 'flowchart TD
    Root --> H12
    Root --> H34
    H12 --> H1
    H12 --> H2' | mermaid-ascii -f -
```

Use bare IDs that are descriptive enough to verify structure (e.g., `Root`, `H12`, `LeafA` — not `A`, `B`, `C`).

Iterate until the ASCII tree looks correct, then delete the preview file.

**mermaid-ascii limitations:**

- **No `[label]` syntax** — causes nodes to duplicate or layout to flatten
- **No `classDef` / `:::class`** — parsed as nodes, breaks everything
- **No subgraphs** — ignored or breaks layout
- **No special node shapes** — only rectangles
- **No `<br/>`** — use single-line labels
- **No `--ascii` flag** — despite what older docs say, current version doesn't have it

**Useful flags:**

- `-f -` — read from stdin
- `-x 8` — increase horizontal spacing
- `-y 8` — increase vertical spacing
- `-p 3` — increase box padding
- `--coords` — show grid coordinates (useful for debugging layout issues)
- `-v` — verbose output (shows parsed graph structure)

### 6. Render and Visually Verify

Render to PNG first (not SVG) so you can **read the image file and visually confirm** the output looks correct:

```bash
# Render PNG for visual verification
mmdc -i static/mmdc/<diagram-name>.mmd -o drafts/img/<diagram-name>.png -b white -s 2

# Read the PNG to visually confirm (use the Read tool on the .png file)
```

Once verified, render the final SVG and promote:

```bash
# Render final SVG
mmdc -i static/mmdc/<diagram-name>.mmd -o drafts/img/<diagram-name>.svg -b white

# After user approval, copy to final location
cp drafts/img/<diagram-name>.svg static/img/<diagram-name>.svg
```

### 7. (Optional) Polish with Gemini Image Generation

If the Mermaid output looks structurally correct but the user wants a more polished or custom-styled result, use `gemini-image.py` to generate a refined version. Feed it the rendered PNG as context along with a description:

```bash
.claude/skills/mermaid-diagram/gemini-image.py drafts/img/<name>-polished.png "Description of the diagram, based on the Mermaid version at drafts/img/<name>.png"
```

Use `-m flash2` for Nano Banana 2, or `-m pro` for Nano Banana Pro. Default is `-m flash` (free tier):

```bash
.claude/skills/mermaid-diagram/gemini-image.py -m flash2 drafts/img/<name>.png "Description..."
```

**Sandbox note:** The `gemini-image.py` script requires network access and writes to the uv cache, both of which are blocked by the default sandbox. Run it with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`.

**Dual-reference technique:** When you need both a specific structure AND a specific visual style, pass two images — one for each concern:

```bash
.claude/skills/mermaid-diagram/gemini-image.py -m pro \
  -i drafts/img/<name>-mermaid.png \
  -i drafts/img/<style-reference>.png \
  drafts/img/<name>.png \
  "Generate a diagram. Image 1 is the TREE STRUCTURE to reproduce. Image 2 is the VISUAL STYLE to match. ..."
```

This prevents Gemini from over-indexing on one image. The Mermaid render provides exact topology; the style reference provides the aesthetic (e.g., hand-drawn Excalidraw look from a previous diagram).

**Iterative refinement:** Pass Gemini's previous output back as `-i` to make targeted fixes. Be very specific about what to change and what to keep ("fix X, keep everything else exactly the same"). Gemini handles small corrections well but tends to drift on open-ended re-prompts. After 2-3 iterations with diminishing returns, accept minor cosmetic imperfections rather than risk regression on correct content. **Layout changes** (centering, spacing, repositioning elements) are largely ignored when a reference image is passed — Gemini locks onto the spatial layout. For layout fixes, regenerate from scratch without the previous output as reference.

**Aspect ratio consistency:** Lock in the aspect ratio from the first generation and keep it for all iterations. Switching (e.g., 16:9 → 21:9) mid-iteration changes proportions and makes the result incompatible with the original image's dimensions when compressing.

**Gemini quirks to avoid:**
- Never mention color hex codes (e.g., `#f0b0a0`) or color names (e.g., `CORAL`) in the context of what a node should *contain* — Gemini will print them as visible text inside the node. Describe colors only as background fills.
- When describing split/two-tone nodes, emphasize that the only text is the label — the colors are purely visual fills with no text labels.
- **Sequential labels** (e.g., 16 hex digits 0-f) are unreliable — Gemini frequently duplicates or skips items. Spelling them out explicitly doesn't help. Accept minor label errors on non-critical background elements.
- **Layout/padding fixes** (e.g., "move the legend left", "add white margins") are mostly ignored. Gemini locks onto the spatial layout from the reference image.

After user approval, copy to `static/img/`.

### 8. Compress and Embed

For Gemini-generated PNGs (typically 500 KB+), compress to WebP before embedding:

```bash
magick static/img/<name>.png -resize 1200x png:- | cwebp -q 90 -o static/img/<name>.webp -- -
rm static/img/<name>.png
```

This typically achieves ~8x size reduction (e.g., 650 KB → 80 KB) with no visible quality loss on diagram-style images.

Embed in the post using **markdown image syntax** (not `<img>` tags — the tabi theme renders them differently, and markdown images integrate better with the content layout):

```markdown
![Description of diagram](/img/<diagram-name>.webp)
```

For SVGs (from Mermaid directly), no compression needed — embed as-is:

```markdown
![Description of diagram](/img/<diagram-name>.svg)
```

## Alternative: Manual ASCII + Gemini Image Generation

If Mermaid can't produce a usable layout at all (e.g., complex spatial arrangements, precise positioning needed), skip Mermaid entirely:

1. **Draft the diagram manually as ASCII art** using Unicode box-drawing characters (`┌─┐│└─┘` for boxes, `─│` for lines, `►▼◄▲` for arrows). Keep labels concise. Align carefully.

2. **Generate a polished image** using `gemini-image.py`. Include the ASCII art in the prompt for spatial guidance:

```bash
.claude/skills/mermaid-diagram/gemini-image.py drafts/img/<name>.png "Description of the diagram to generate"
```

After user approval, copy to `static/img/`.

1. The user may also choose to use the ASCII art directly in the post (inside a code block), or feed it to an external image generator themselves.

## Tools

### mermaid-ascii

Terminal preview of Mermaid diagrams as ASCII art. Supports flowcharts and sequence diagrams.

- **Repo:** <https://github.com/AlexanderGrooff/mermaid-ascii>
- **Installed at:** `~/.local/bin/mermaid-ascii`
- **Update script:** `~/.local/bin/update-mermaid-ascii`

### gemini-image.py

Python script that generates images from text prompts via the Gemini API. Uses `uv run --script` for dependency management — no install needed.

- **Location:** `.claude/skills/mermaid-diagram/gemini-image.py`
- **Requires:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Models:** `flash` (default, free tier), `flash2` (Nano Banana 2), or `pro` (Nano Banana Pro, supports 2K resolution)

**Usage:**

```bash
gemini-image.py [options] <output-path> <prompt>

Options:
  -m, --model {flash,pro}    Model to use (default: flash)
  -i, --image <path>         Input image as reference (can be repeated)
  -s, --size {1K,2K}         Output resolution (default: 1K, 2K requires pro model)
  -a, --aspect-ratio <ratio> Aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9, 3:2, 1:1)
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic generation
gemini-image.py drafts/img/diagram.png "A flowchart showing..."

# With reference image (e.g., Mermaid render)
gemini-image.py -i drafts/img/mermaid-render.png drafts/img/polished.png "Transform this into Excalidraw style..."

# High resolution with pro model
gemini-image.py -m pro -s 2K -i input.png output.png "Regenerate at higher resolution..."
```

### gemini-prompt-template.md

Prompt template for Gemini image generation. Contains:

- Standard prompt structure
- Color palettes (default, warm, cool)
- Example prompts
- Tips for effective generation

**Location:** `.claude/skills/mermaid-diagram/gemini-prompt-template.md`

Use this template as a starting point, especially for the Excalidraw hand-drawn style. Key principle: **keep diagrams clean, put explanations in the blog post text** — avoid annotations cluttering the image.

### beautiful-mermaid (not installed)

Node/TypeScript library for rendering Mermaid as SVG or ASCII with theming. Supports more diagram types than mermaid-ascii (flowcharts, sequence, state, class, ER). Could replace `mmdc` for SVG rendering.

- **Repo:** <https://github.com/lukilabs/beautiful-mermaid>
- **Install:** `npm install beautiful-mermaid`

## Quick Syntax Reference

### Flowchart Basics

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Rectangle] --> B(Rounded)
    A --> C{Decision}
    C -->|Yes| D[(Database)]
    C -->|No| E((Circle))
```

**Node shapes:** `[rect]`, `(rounded)`, `{diamond}`, `[(database)]`, `((circle))`, `[[subroutine]]`, `>flag]`

**Edges:** `-->` solid arrow, `-.->` dotted, `==>` thick, `---` no arrow, `-->|label|` with label

**Subgraphs:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph GroupName
        A --> B
    end
```

### Sequence Diagram Basics

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>Bob: Hello
    Bob-->>Alice: Hi
    Alice->>Alice: Think
```

**Arrows:** `->>` solid, `-->>` dotted, `-x` cross, `-)` open

### Styling (for mmdc output only)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A:::green --> B:::blue
    classDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333
    classDef blue fill:#69f,stroke:#333
```

## Conventions

- Source `.mmd` files go in `static/mmdc/`
- Final SVGs/images for the blog go in `static/img/`
- Use white background (`-b white`) for blog theme compatibility
- See `static/mmdc/` for existing examples of style and frontmatter usage
- **Drafts and previews** go in `drafts/img/` (iCloud-synced for iPad input, gitignored)
  - User may add sketches (Freeform → PDF) or annotated PNGs from iPad — both readable directly
  - Convert PDF to PNG if needed: `magick input.pdf output.png`
  - All intermediate output goes here before promoting to `static/img/`
